class BaseApproximant(object):
    """
    Base class of function approximants.

    Interpolate/extrapolate univariate functions.

    BaseApproximant(`x`, `y`)

    `x` and `y` are arrays with values used to approximate 
    some function f: ``y = f(x)``.

    Including derivatives as input:
    If `x` has one element repeted in the list, the values of `y` at the 
    same position are assumed to be the derivatives of the function at
    that point, i.e. if x[m] = 1.5 and x[m+1] = 1.5, then y[m] = f(x) and
    y[m+1] = f'(x), etc.


    Attributes
    ----------

    _xlen: int
        Length of input points where the function was evaluated.
    _ider: int or list(int)
        If derivatives are provided,`_ider` stores the location of the `x`
        value.

    Methods
    -------

    __call__(x, der)
